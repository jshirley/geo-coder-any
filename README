NAME
    Geo::Coder::Any - Use flexible (and custom) geocoders

VERSION
    Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
    Geo::Coder::Any is a processing pipeline for coupling and normalizing
    Geo::Coder modules. Geo::Coder::Google and Geo::Coder::Yahoo support is
    shipped within this module.

        use Geo::Coder::Any;

        my $ga = Geo::Coder::Any->new();
        my $results = $ga->geocode('1600 Pennsylvania Ave Washington DC');

ATTRIBUTES
  steps

    A step is an individual geocoder that will attempt a lookup and returns
    a match or if no match is found it is to return undef.

steps
    This is configured upon creation, such as:

        Geo::Coder::Any->new(
            steps => [ 
                'Google' => { api_key => 'abcdef' },
                'Yahoo'  => { api_key => 'byah'   },
            ]
        );

METHODS
  geocode($address)

    Iterate through the steps (see definition above) until we get a valid
    response.

INTERNAL METHODS
    Here be dragons, you've been warned. =head2 BUILD

    Setup the Geo::Coder::Any object and the steps.

    Construction is:

     Geo::Coder::Any->new(
        steps => [
            'Google' => {
                api_key => 'abcdefghjijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
            },
            'Yahoo'  => {
                appid => 'wharrrrgarrrrgarrrrgarrrrrbllll'
             },
        ] 
     );
